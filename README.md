Codes (and data) for reproducing the results of the paper "Experimental discovery of structure-property relationships in ferroelectric materials via active learning"

The Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the deep kernel learning for dummy BEPS data analysis and simulate an experiment on a dummy BEPS data. This notebook can also be adapted for analyzing other datasets.

As an example, the video shows a 10-steps DKL-driven piezoresponse spectroscopy measurement.
